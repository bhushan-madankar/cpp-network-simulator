# cpp-network-simulator
project made with c++ which simulates the network attack and trace the packet path 

Developed a C++-based network security simulation to model and analyze Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, incorporating realistic network parameters, packet handling, and path tracing to visualize attack routes.
